# PixelNode_Input_MPR121
Inputs from Adafruits MPR121 touch sensor via a python subprocess. (Needs Adafruit_Python_MPR121)

## Python Library
You'll need to install Adafruits python library for it to work. 

You may want to use the forked version, as it handles some minor bugs and allows to use two sensors on two i2c-buses:
